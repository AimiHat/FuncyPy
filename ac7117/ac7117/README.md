#### How will this code be used ?
In team-work phase, we will decide whether to use this runtime or the lambda alternative (or a combination of both).
The modules should be compiled in the same order as proposed in the team work plan. 

#### Which parts if any are code written for other people?
None

#### Which parts if any of code you use is written by others?
None

#### What help have you obtained/given others debugging or doing code review?
Minimal, we were mostly independent in this.

#### How did you work out (who decided what - how do you revise) the types that interface your code with others?
We agreed to an initial AST design in team work plan phase. Made some further changes after feedback, and then
drifted closer to the original design proposed on the support page. After individual submission we plan to meet and make all adjustments necessary to interface our code.


**Note:** Evaluation originally implemented in applicative order, was changed to lazy evaluation in hopes of making Y-combinator work.
