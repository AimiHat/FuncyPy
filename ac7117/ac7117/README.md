How will your code be used by team (if all goes well) including what order are modules in your team project compiled?

### How will this code be used ?
When team-work phase starts, we will decide whether to use this runtime or the lambda alternative (or a combination of both).
The modules should be compiled in the same order as proposed in the team work plan. 

### Which parts if any are code written for other people?
None

### Which parts if any of code you use is written by others?
None

### What help have you obtained/given others debugging or doing code review?
Minimal, we were mostly independent in this.

### How did you work out (who decided what - how do you revise) the types that interface your code with others?
We agreed to an initial Ast design in team work plan phase. Made some further changes after feedback, and then overtime 
we've drifted closer to the original design proposed on the website. After indiv. submission we will meet and make any adjustments necessary to match our code. 

I do not want a report-style statement, just the above info as concisely as possible.
